<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>This portoflio site is the documentation of my journey to recapture the joy I felt at being a subject matter expert in delivering two outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rapid Application Development using Borland Paradox</li>
  <li>Data warehouse and business intelligence using Microsoft SQL Server</li>
</ul>

<p>I have chosen 3 areas to focus on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web Development - to ensure I have a full understandning of the basic building blocks of application development</li>
  <li>Data Management - Microsoft SQL Server sample data running in Docker containers and various API sourced data</li>
  <li>Application Development - Building applications using Flutter</li>
  <li>Python - A language that seems fitting to an application developer and a data enthusiast</li>
</ul>

<p>My learning resources will be many of the usual sources, but I have chosen the following Udemy courses to kick start me off:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/">The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/15-days-of-power-bi/">15 days of Power BI - Complete Microsoft Power BI Bootcamp</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>My Goals</h3>
<p>To develop:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An application to assist the Treasurer of a small non-proft/social organisation</li>
  <li>Find a job developing data and BI solutions</li>
  <li>Build a quiver of skills to freelance with when I'm retired</li>
  <li>Write a book: <strong>Still Struggling after 40 Years of IT</strong> <em>How architectural and functional role segregation broke IT (and what you should do about it)</em></li>
  <li>Write a book: <strong>Delivering Data Management</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In the mid 90's I would have added an horrendous graphic depicting "Under Construction" but as this site has no functionality that will tople big business, I plan to publish, warts and all, as I go.</p>

<h2>The Detailed History (wip)</h2>
<p>I am a product of the growth of Information Technology.</p>

<p>My father was an electronics wizard and I grew up surounded by his projects. Most notably:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A self build kit version of a Pong TV console</li>
  <li>Some device built with a ribbon cable conneted remote interface similar to a Sinclair Cambridge calculator</li>
  <li>A hand built metal detector</li>
  <li>Voltage regulators</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually, this led to a Commodore PET computer and eventually to an Apple II. Both of which were connected to instruments he'd designed to improve the manufacturing process for his business.</p>

<p>Whilst his passion did not directly drive my own learning (if only I'd started to learn to code on the Commodore PET when I was 9 or 10!) it did intorduce me to computing and I remember keying in pages and pages of magazine provided basic code into the PET so that I could play that particular game, if I didn't make a mistake.</p>

<p>I studied electronics and became a systems engineer, but always found the writing of code more interesting. I my early days on Naval defense systems, I would need to write code that analysed test output and printed reports to verify performance. These programs were written on paper templates that the typing pool would key in to the computers and were output to paper tape. A fond memory is of debugging the resulting code by finding the failure section and <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/telex/repair/">splicing in hand punched characters to replace the errors</a>.</p>

<p>This led to a move to the commercial world where I would learn to program early PCs in solving small business problems that mainframe development was deemed too expensive to use. Happy days of fixing PC's, printers and building networks as well as writting local 4GL database applications.</p>

<p>In the early days there was no sharing of data, other than moving floppy disks around. During this period I learnt analysis of requirements, code structuring, procedural flow, user interface design, the value of building libraries of shared utilities (code reuse). Unfortunately, I never progressed to deeper languages, prefering to design forms using a tool over using code. The process was termed Rapid Application Development and this iterative code, test, demo, fail, learn, fix, retest, approve, deploy cycle was in use long before I heard the term Agile.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have been solving business functionality problems using logic and technology throughout my entire career. I was exposed to personel computing before the age of 11 and have enjoyed being an interface between the hardware and the business community by developing solutions to solve business problems.</p>

<p>These solutions have been in terms of applications, data analysis, reporting, data management and governance, data transformation and warehousing. All of this has been with a passion for doing the job correctly.</p>

<p>Of late the expanse of technology tooling and the exponential growth and diversification of businesses providing those, all very similiar but marketed by huge budgets to be "the only tool your business will ever need" has confused the delivery of IT solutions.</p>

<p>I wanted to return to "simpler" times and decided that I needed to specialise again. My chosed focal points for specialisation were all about being able to recreate the precision and seriousness I took with my early development footsteps. Since the late 90s technology has improved massively, but the practices used to code, and deliver excellence, has not. I will apply what makes me tick to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web development practices</li>
  <li>Modern architecture for Continuous Integration</li>
  <li>Cross platform applications</li>
  <li>Data management disciplines and practices</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>Microsoft Power BI</li>
    <li>Data quality importance, assessment and monitoring</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Release management, version control, continuous integration</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
