 <h1>Paul's List of Movies</h1>
 
 <p>The aim of this excersise was to comprehand the use of tags to define text sections. Using h1, h2, h3 and p tags to define a basic structure. For me the important part, at this stage of learning, is to learn and understand the code development aspects rather than the content creation, I just came up with silly examples of 3 movies. Later I will use the growth into matching code development with styling concepts to build pages that I hope function correctly and are pleasing to look at and use. I am not a fan of web pages (or applications) that are only about functionality and do not incorporate useability nor aesthetics.</p>
